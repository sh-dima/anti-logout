# AntiLogout

## Overview

**AntiLogout** is a server-side mod that prevents players from escaping combat by logging out. When a player logs out during combat, their "body" remains online for a configurable amount of time, making combat logging impossible. The mod also provides a flexible `/afk` command to safely go AFK for farming or other purposes.

---

## Features

- Prevents combat logging: players who log out during combat remain in the world.
- `/afk` command: lets players logout with the account still online, with optional time limits.
- Configurable messages and timeouts.
- Permission-based command and feature access.

1. Download the mod JAR and place it in your server's `mods` folder.
2. Start the server to generate the config file.
